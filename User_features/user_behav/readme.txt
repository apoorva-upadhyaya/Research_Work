User Behavior : We scrutinize the Big Five Model(Big5) [Ack19] to acquire personality traits (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). 
We make use of the Personality Insights service of IBM Cloud. 
In order to predict the scores of each of the five traits, we fed a maximum of 3200 previous tweets of the users extracted using the script(user_past_tweets.py) and find the personality trait scores using (user_physco.py) script.
